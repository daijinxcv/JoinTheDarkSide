# NOTE
I have no idea why you have to sometimes double tap on the login/register button for it to work. Sometimes the app will not update the list of todos after creating new account, just log-in back again.

# INSTALLATION
1. <b>Clone</b> or <b>download</b> this repository. 
2. Run via <b>NPM</b>. 
3. Do not forget to run the boilerplate-api, or this will not work properly. 
4. Do not forget to update the ip addresses in the <b>App.js</b> file.
5. Do not forget to create the database. I have included an exported sql file for your convenience. Just make sure you have the appropriate software to run the .sql file named <b>TodoExpress.sql</b>.
